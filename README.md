# TorGate

TorGate is a proxy service that enables access to [Tor Network](https://torproject.org/) hidden services via regular web browsers. 

This project is based on [tor2web](https://github.com/tor2web), which was original developed by Aaron Swartz and Virgil Griffith, and subsequently maintained by Giovanni Pellerano of the GlobaLeaks project.
